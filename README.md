# ARCfacegame
A set of python/opencv files which build up to make a face-controlled game

* Week 1: drops falling, moving sideways
* Week 2: play with facedetector, look at parameters of face detector
* Week 3: collision detection - when does a face hit a drop/block?
* Week 4: game work (scores, polishing, debugging)

Each folder contains start files, and helper files.  There are also examples of
successful code (usually in the folder for the following week, which lets you
hold back the answers if you give the work a week at a time).

Instructions for kids are on Google Docs here:
